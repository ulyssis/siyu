Professional website for Sarah Jane Schmidt: <a href='http://sarahjaneschmidt.com'>www.sarahjaneschmidt.com</a>.

If you're seeing this page, you might be interested in how I put this page together. It is based off of the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). I found it clean and simple, and love the way it displays project pages and publications. It's slightly more complicated than the average jekyll site on github because jekyll-scholar (used to manage publications) is not available on github, so the site won't deploy automatically. The theme has a deploy script, and instructions for that and the whole process are on the theme site.

When I built this page I had no idea what jekyll, ruby, and bundles are, and I still only know enough to poke around elements and colors. If you're also new to these things, you might find these links helpful:
